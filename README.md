# matchstick
Toy program to generate matchstick diagrams of ordinals.

Matchstick diagrams are a way to visualize ordinals.
They are helpful in learning to understand the order types of some small ordinals.
After *ω³* or so, everything starts to look about the same, and it is difficult to tell at a glance what ordinal a matchstick diagram represents.

This was a one-off project, more comparable to a script than an app.
The code quality is not representative of what I usually make, and the code is not easily reusable for other purposes,
but I am publishing it anyway for educational purposes, in hopes that others may learn from it.
The only reason I chose Java was for a balance of ease of use and performance -
the rendering code is about as simple as it can get,
and Java is usually not too much slower at heavy computation work compared to the C/C++ equivalents.
If not for the performance concerns, I would have gone with Python as usual.
